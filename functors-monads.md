# Functors, Monads, Monoids

## Associativity
`x + ( y + z ) === ( x + y ) + z`

## Commutativity
`y + z === z + y`

`y * z === z * y`

## Monoid
Is a collection of things and a rule for combining those things.
The rule for combining those things must follow 2 meta rules: associativity and special member.

A monoid must contain a special member that when x combined witht the special member always equals x.
x + sm = x;

It does not have to satisfy communativity.

## Functor
types that map, must be 
## Semi Group
types that have concat, concat must be associative.

## Monads
